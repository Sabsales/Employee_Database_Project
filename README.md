# Employee_Database_Project
This project was forumulated to gather and analyze data on employees that are retiring or have the potential to do so.
Purpose

The purpose of the project is to analyze the employee data and determine the employees most likely to retire in the next few years.

Analysis

Analysis of the data brought forward a few key points:

    •  The data output from the Retiring Titles table shows a large number of senior employees.

    • The significance of the above image, is based on the data shown is that in the next few years we can expect to see a tsunami of retiring employees.

Summary

The overall analysis of the data provided proved to be limiting. The focus of only retiring employees felt that it limited the effectiveness and impact of the analysis. An alternative analysis focus could have been an analysis on all employees while filtering for employees and either were of a certain age or have been in the company for a certain amount of time. While the current analysis does provide some insight to retiring employees as depicted in the data point in the Analysis section. The majority of employees are of titles of seniority and that can point towards likelihood of retirement. However with additional data and a broader focus, the analysis could have been far more complex and insightful into the overall status of employees.
